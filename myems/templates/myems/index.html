        <p style="text-align: justify">
            This site shows the roster for the Robot Sports Team. The site generates a random list of robo players with
            their attributes like Speed, Agility, and Strength. The Values are set to a random number making the total sum
            for the whole team below 175.<br/>
            The players have a unique and easy to remember name. The players also have a unique alphanumeric sequence number
            which is generated at runtime and will be different each time the website is loaded.

        <h2>Working Details</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify">The implementation of this website is done on Django Python framework. The site uses
        Django DTL syntax for embedding server code into web pages at runtime.<br/>
        The actual algorithm to generate the attributes related to players is implemented into a python file which is generate
            a list and this is consumed into views.
        The code inside the python file returns a list of objects which is consumed by the Django view code.
